**Have you ever wanted to tell the guy behind you in traffic what you really think?**
Then this is the project for you!

This code allows you to send messages to an LED display and have them scroll across.

## The hardware you'll need

1. You'll need an Arduino (I've used an UNO)
2. An LED board: in this case a RGBmatrixPanel https://www.robotics.org.za/AF2279
3. An ESP2688 wifi module

## The software you'll need

1. Android studio to run the android code
2. Arduino IDE to debug your hardware

## Putting it all together

Once you've attached all your electronic components, plug your android phone directly into your PC and install the app. From the app you'll be able to send messages with the click of a button and you can watch it scroll across the screen.

## Notes
1. If the colour of your text is dimmer or more yellow than you expect, it's because you arent supplying enough power to show the colours you want
2. Make sure you're connected to the module when attempting to send messages
3. Swear words are permitted so go crazy

More app functionallity coming soon
